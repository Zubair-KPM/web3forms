Web3Forms Integration
What is Web3Forms?
Web3Forms is a powerful, easy-to-use, and privacy-first backend form service that allows you to handle form submissions without writing server-side code. It works seamlessly with static websites by processing the form data and sending it directly to your email without the need for additional backend setup.

Prerequisites
Before integrating Web3Forms, ensure the following:

You have a static HTML website or a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, etc.).
Youâ€™ve signed up and obtained a Web3Forms access key.
You have an email address ready to receive form submissions.
How to Integrate Web3Forms
Follow these steps to integrate Web3Forms with your website:

Step 1: Sign Up and Get an Access Key
Visit Web3Forms and sign up for a free account.
After registration, you will get a unique access key. Copy this key, as it will be required for the form configuration.
Step 2: Add the Form to Your Website
Add the following form markup to your HTML file. Replace the YOUR_ACCESS_KEY with your actual Web3Forms access key:

Step 3: Add Required Fields
The access_key field is required for Web3Forms to identify your form submission.
Ensure that your form uses the method POST and the action https://api.web3forms.com/submit.

Step 4: Test the Form
Open your website and fill out the form.
Submit the form and check your email for the submission data.
If you've set up a redirect, you will be taken to the specified "Thank You" page upon successful submission.
Step 5: Handle Form Errors
Web3Forms automatically handles form validation. If you want to display custom messages for errors or after successful submissions, you can do so using JavaScript.
